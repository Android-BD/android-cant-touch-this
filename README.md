# The Can'tTouchThis Demo Application

Can’tTouchThis is a quick and fun application which uses the Wunderbar Accelerometer/Gyroscope sensor and the relayr Cloud Platform to alert when your wallet/keys/cello/elephant has been touched, stolen or moved. It will also give you an idea as to how to implement the [relayr Android SDK](https://github.com/relayr/android-sdk) in order to create your very own application. 

Simply place your sensor on the item you wish to monitor and show people that they Can’t Touch This!
